A lot of my motivation for learning to code was to be able to set myself apart in the journalism field. I'm still in my junior year of undergrad, but one of the careers I'm really looking into is journalism - what's the new thing there? Data journalism. 

However, I've realized a lot more similarities between coding and journalism than I expected - that's what I'm going to explore today in my blog post. 

Firstly, there's a language. AP Style is a style adhered to by most newspapers, since it leads to simplicity and is widely accepted. It's a certain way of writing: all newspapers use p.m. rather than PM, for example. This is meant to make the job easier for the reader, rather than them interchangeably across news outlets. This seems really similar to coding to me because we all use certain conventions. All of the refactoring of code, to make it more readable to other coders - that's the same thing of using AP Style in writing! To make it easily understandable by other journalists. 

Secondly, there's a format we follow. There's specific ways we define our methods and variables to be sure, but it's broader than that. Learning about object orientation and the different ways we use ActiveRecord and Associations to spread our code out from different parts to make it more readable: that's the same thing as the inverted pyramid in journalism. 

Journalism starts out with a lead, then a quote that underscores the main point in your lead. After that follows more background information, then more quotes and more information. But the most important stuff goes at the top of the article and then the background info follows after. If you need the important stuff you know to look at the top, but if you want background info you need to look later in the article. There's a structure to it all, similar to coding.

Those are pretty basic examples, but when I think about the similarities, I come up with a lot more. I view coding and journalism in the same light - trying to provide a service for the user. It takes a lot of background work and a lot of research and a lot of trying and failing to fit the right information into your product. However, the user only interacts with the barebones. Background research is like googling how to use Associations or how to use Ruby Gems. Interviews are like setting up Associations and database tables to pull from. Then you have to compile it all into a format for the user, or reader to interact with.

Since I'm really passionate about investigative journalism, I also view them in really similar ways. I see articles as seeking to solve a problem or answer a question. And that's a lot of how I view coding with Learn - seeking to solve a problem. 

That's why I applied to Learn the second time and followed through on my application. Methodology I've learned from Learn - breaking it into tests and accomplishing one thing at a time is something I've started applying to writing journalistic articles. I need a lead, I need a strong quote and then I need my background information. 

I've learned a lot from Learn, not just about how to write code, but how to address problems and work through a project. It's helped me stay organized and stay focused in multitasking and for that, even if I don't become a full time web developer, I'll always use.
