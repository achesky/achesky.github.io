Today, I'm a bit crunched for time and creativity so I'm going to go with the Learn prompt, which is "Explain responsive layout to your mom." 

Everyone views websites on different screens. My laptop is a 15 inch, desktop and a phone or tablet screen is smaller. This means that the website page shows up differently on different screens. If my facebook feed had the same font size and same appearance as it does on my computer and on my iPhone, that would be pretty frustrating and unreasonable, because they are of such different sizes .Facebook has an app, which changes the layout, but sometimes we view it on our phone's browser. In order for this to be a) effective, but also b) consumer-friendly, we need a **responsive layout**. 

This means that arrangement of our Facebook home page changes depending on how big the screen (or window) is that we're viewing it on. For example, if I have Facebook next to a bunch of other windows on my laptop, the window isn't actually going to be the same size as my display screen is. If the webpage was only formatted for the whole length of my webpage, I would have some trouble, even though it is still on the same device. 

First, let me explain the way that the size is measured. Every display screen and window has a certain amount of **pixels** in it. This is a tiny area on your screen that is a unit of measurement in this case. While programming, we can adjust our page's format to see at what width the page is going to start looking a little funky. Maybe the sections of the menu at the top will be a bit too squished together or our images will start being really close to the text of the page. We note down that size and then program in different layouts for our page based off of the different sizes! 

Maybe that was a bit hectic so let's recap: screens have different sizes. When we program, we take into account the different sizes and change the way the web page appears depending on the size of the screen. 

Let me get a bit into the mechanics of how this works. On a web page, there might be a few different columns of text, and a few different pictures side by side. When we program, we can delineate those different columns and then rearrange them based on the size. On a desktop, we'd probably want the columns side by side - if the content followed one after another, desktop or laptop users would be scrolling for a very long time. But, on a phone, we'd like to be able to scroll down through all of the images. 

We can adjust the size of the font, by setting our text size to a measurement called "em", which will adjust the size to be proportional to the size of our screen. We can make the height of our images and our tbales or forms automatic too, but we can also program it in ourselves. Sometimes the menu adjusts to a little icon that we click on in order to open up the different links, rather than displaying across the top of our page. 

Responsive layout is one of my favorite things I've learned so far in Learn, because now I see it constantly on the different web pages I access on my phone and computer. I'm sure you'll start seeing it too, Mom!
