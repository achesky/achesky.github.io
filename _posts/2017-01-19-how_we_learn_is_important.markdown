I'm currently in my junior year of college. I took the SATs to get into college along with many high school exams. I have taken many exams while in college and will take more before I graduate, along with possible graduate school entrance exams. Tests are frustrating and difficult, but really they don't help me learn anything. I memorize, I read the textbook, I go to class, but I don't remember what I learned in my Contemporary China class my freshman fall. 

I believe that's because I didn't care about the class. In my opinion, there weren't meaningful problems to solve and there weren't interesting answers. We met once a week for three hours and I thoroughly annotated the readings before attending class, but I wasn't quite sure what we were looking for. During class and after, I still wasn't quite sure what we were looking for. 

However, one part of that class was a map. Using Google Maps, we traced out an important path from Chinese history. We took time out from lectures and met with an IT guy who helped us learn how to manipulate the program to do what we wanted. Now **that** was learning. The answers weren't in front of me in the textbook and they weren't in a solution manual. I was creating the map that I wanted to create the way I saw it in my mind's eye. I was using tools to help me develop what I needed to showcase my thoughts, my idea, my project, my opinion. 

Really, I think that's what coding is. Using tools to help you develop your own project or ideas - creating in a way different from drawing or painting. There are incredible programs being developed for speech recognition that *The Economist* highlighted this week and many more NLPs being used by hedge funds to analyze tweets to make trades. My iPhone has an immense computing capability and so does the laptop I'm currently typing this on. AI and computers and machines are making deeper and deeper strides into our lives. 

None of that should be news to anyone - college students don't feel tests are helping them and computers are becoming incredibly commonplace in our day-to-day life. Yet, that's still why I decided to enroll in Learn's Online Full Stack Web Development Course. I felt that I needed to start somewhere. I love test-driven development and the way it challenged me in the lead-up courses to starting the full program. I love the fact that the answer is right in front of me, I just need to find it. I love the discipline and the creativity and the ability to edit and critique your own work that is necessary. I love that I can create something that is so prevalent every single day - currently I'm using a website to type this and scrolling through another on my phone - and do it professionally and nicely. 

Most of all, I just like learning. I could have learned all of this in other places, but I like the Flatiron School. I'm impressed by the mission to create an incredible learning community and curriculum and their commitment to getting students like myself to love coding, not just know how to code. I'm incredibly proud to be part of a community that is centered around doing what they love and learning in productive ways - I believe that is something special.
